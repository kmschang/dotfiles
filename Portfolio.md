### Swift
- I was always passionate about technology and my famiy was always an Apple Famliy. As Swift was introduced back in 2014, I knew that it was something I wanted to learn and eventually publish my wown app to the App Store. Before this, I had no background in coding so when I started learning Swift, I started from scratch. I began learning Swift by watching online tutorials with my dad. By the time highschool came around, I had made a few very simple apps, but was never able to publish them to the App Store. As high school went on, I got more involved in school activities and Swift took the back seat for a while. When I moved off to college, my passion and desire to publish an app to the App Store was rekindled, and I have been working on that goal daily ever since. With a basics knowledge from before and some recent python knowledge it was easy to start the app and as I started learning Java in class, I had all the pieces I needed to finally make the app I always dreamed of making. As of now, I am in the final stages of making and publishing my first app the App Store and in the process of designing and coding a second one.

### Python

- I started programming in Python during high school. In the beginning, I watched online tutorials to learn how to code. As I learned more and got more comfortable, I started venturing out and making my own programs. My most notable project would by my TicTacToe game. I have finished coding it about 4 years ago now. At the time I was coding it, I was still in the early stages of learning python and I didn't have a complete understanding of the more advanced topics. However, desipte having only a preliminarily understanding, I was able to finish the program without having to follow an online tutorial. One I finished that program, I got more comfortable and started working on more projects. Since attending computer science classes at college, I have put python on the back burner as the focus of these classes is Java.

### Java
- I just started learning Java over the last year in my Object Oriented Programming classes at college. I've been picking it up farily fast because I had a basic knowledge in Swift and Python. Since my classes are all focued on Java, I feel I have learned the most and feel the most comfortable with this language. I am coding in java almost everyday either in class or in my free time. I've been woring on many projects since I started learning Java including a revised TicTacToe game. After going to class and learning more about Java, I was able to complete this TicTacToe version using more advanced topics allowing me to fill it with more details. In the revised version, you are able to change what character you want to be, and how big you want to make the board (3x3 up to 10x10). Along with the TicTacToe project, there are other larger projects that I made for OOP classes. Separately, I have smaller projects in there that I made for fun to practice different aspects of Java.


### Other Coding
- Along my journey of learning these three languages, I have learned a lot more about coding and technology. I have learned things like Git, Vi, bash, scripts, and much more. I have a repository called dotfiles which has all my "other" and "administrative" files and programs that I used. I have been working on making hooks in git for my GitHub account and I am also working on making more scripts to help streamline the coding process.

### GitHub

- I have provided a link to my GitHub account, where I made certain repositories publicly accessible. These repositories showcase some of my current projects, including Java, Python, and my dotfiles. I chose not to make my Swift repository public, as I am currently in the middle of finishing an app to be published on the Apple App Store. My GitHub account only show a portion of what I have been up to and what I have learning so far. I am eager to learn more, improve my previous programs, and program more advanced projects. Thank you for taking the time to look over some of the projects I have under my belt and I hope you liked what you saw. I look forward to talking further about any questions you may have and how I can be an asset to your company.
